Some people have asked me about licensing -- in the minimum all source code will be available via a copyleft license such as GPLv3 or the AGPL.
MIT and other very liberal licenses are being considered, but I'm a kopimist at heart, so until then, forget the copyright system.
For my true peers, my publishing this code is good enough.
